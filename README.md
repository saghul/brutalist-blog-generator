# Brutalist Blog Generator

This is a simple blog generator built using Swift so I can learn the language.

## Usage

Make sure you have the Swift SDK installed first. Then run:

```bash
make release
```

Configure the site by editing the `config.yml` file. You can then run:

```bash
.build/release/bbg build
```

And the site will be built in the output directory, which defaults to `./build`.

## Contributing

Since this is a project to learn Swift I'd rather not have contributions in the form of PRs. However, if you have
any suggestions or find any issues, please open an issue. I'm here to learn :-)
